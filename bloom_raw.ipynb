      "To write a compelling hero in a period drama about the history of aviation, the challenges were many. On the surface, World War I must have been a time of great change. I wanted to make sure my heroine had a compelling and unique storyline. But, I also knew that at the time, the aviation industry was in its infancy. The number of women flying planes at that time was still very small, and most of the major aircraft were designed by men. So, it took a lot of research on my part to figure out the best way to merge the needs of the story with the reality of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began by reading a number of historical books on the subject, which helped me understand the engineering and design challenges that were involved. I also spent hours on the internet, searching out pictures of women who had flown planes at the time. I needed to find the right mix of strength and vulnerability in my heroine. Once I had the foundation for the story laid, it was time to write. It was a long process, but one that was well worth it in the end.\n",

      "To write a compelling hero in a period video game about the history of aviation, it helps to have a good idea of what it was like to be a pilot in the 1930s. And sometimes the best source of information is a real-life pilot from the period. This is why we got a call from Cliff at the beginning of this year: “Hey, can I use your name and a picture of you in a game?” Cliff was a civilian pilot in the Air Force during the war, and is still very active in flying. He flew two different types of fighters, a couple of planes that no longer exist, and is a much respected member of the old fighter pilots association, the Silver Wings. So we gave him the good news and asked him to send us a few photos to use as reference for the character.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to wait until Cliff was in town, since he lives out of the country, but we were very lucky to have him here at the same time as we were working on the game, so we were able to meet him and get a few in-game shots of him as well. You can see him as a playable pilot in Rising Storm, but this will be the first time that you’ll be able to fly with Cliff himself. He also agreed to take part\n"
