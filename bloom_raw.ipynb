      "To write a compelling hero in a period video game about the history of aviation, there are lots of challenges. There are so many aviation historians out there who could tell a better story than a developer could. There are just so many people who have a deep knowledge of history and they can write about it and put it in a story. I guess I can kind of sit in the middle ground and tell a story that is accessible to people that have some knowledge about aviation history, but that doesn’t require that they have the deep knowledge. That is a challenge. I think if you’re telling a story about the history of aviation, you need to have that deep knowledge, but if you want to tell a story about a modern day fighter pilot, you don’t have to have that deep knowledge. It kind of depends on the story.\n",
