      "To write a compelling hero in a period drama about the history of aviation, you need to understand the man as a person first, then his personality can be heightened by his heroic deeds. For this, you need a deep understanding of the historical events and the time in which he lived. This was achieved by creating an extensive library of reference material about aviation and the 1920’s, consulting many books about the history of aviation and the early days of airmail and observing the period dramas made in the last ten years such as Man of the Air, The Aviator and the forthcoming The Wright Brothers.\n",
