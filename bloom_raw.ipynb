As he got older, he learned that in aviation, you have to fly as slow as you can and as high as you can. He made the wise choice to do that, and when he got to space, he was the most calm and collected person I’ve ever met. He was always in control of the situation, no matter what the stress was. He was always able to focus his mind and put things together in such a way that you knew\n"
