It was Yeager who set the bar for what is considered to be the speed of sound. In 1960, he became the first pilot to break the sound barrier in the Bell X-1. He achieved a Mach 1.06. To this day, Yeager is the only man who has broken the sound barrier twice. He was the first to break the sound barrier with a rocket and a jet-powered airplane. His story is one of perseverance and tenacity. He was a hero to the nation and the world.\n",
