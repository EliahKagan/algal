The way he looks at the jungle is as if he were looking at a sexy woman.\n",

      "To write a compelling hero in a period video game about the history of aviation, we need to understand what traits make for a compelling character in historical fiction. The first is the “epic hero”, whose journey is not just physical, but psychological. They come into the story a strong character, and leave it a stronger one, having evolved during their journey. In the last decade of games, we’ve seen the “realistic hero” emerge, whereby the hero of the story is not a hero in the traditional sense. They’re not always good, and they don’t have to save the day. They’re flawed, but because they’re human they’re relatable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would go as far to say that realistic heroes are more effective in a video game, because the audience can relate to them more than an epic hero. This is because, as we’ve already stated, the protagonist of a video game is usually a “realistic” human being, so the player can relate to them. This can be seen in the recent game series The Last of Us and Uncharted. The character Joel and Nathan Drake are both flawed, but they’re also both fascinating and relatable to the player.\n",
