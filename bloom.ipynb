      "To write a compelling hero in a period video game about the history of aviation, you need to know more than just the airplanes. The most successful games in the genre have an excellent understanding of the historical period as well. This applies to subjects like culture, politics, and society as well as aviation. Take the WW2 games, for instance. They have excellent depictions of the military, the visuals are top-notch, and the graphics engine is impressive. But these games also have an excellent understanding of the period’s culture and society. They accurately depict the horrors of war, the horrors of the camps, and the struggles of daily life in the occupied countries. These games are not just about flying airplanes. They are also about the experiences of the people of that period. And just like with Heroes in the Sky, these experiences are at the core of the gameplay.\n",

They also tend to be more realistic, and the gameplay is more engaging because of that. There’s a reason these games are so popular with gamers. They offer a more authentic experience. They allow you to explore the world around you and become a part\n"
