      "To write a compelling hero in a period drama about the history of aviation, I knew I would need to go back in time to discover exactly what it meant to be a pilot in 1919. With so many resources available to learn about the early days of aviation, I decided to head out and see for myself! I began to fly with the World War I Flying Legends at airshows around the country.\n",

As I flew with them, I began to write a script that I thought would be very powerful. I really felt that this story would bring a new perspective to the often-neglected first phase of aviation. A few years later, the FAA commissioned an aviation history film that would share the stories of the greatest pilots of the era. The script I had written for that film evolved into the one that you see today.\n"
