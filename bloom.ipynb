      "To write a compelling hero in a period drama about the history of aviation, what’s the best way to do it? Do you go for a highly educated pilot, like Gary Cooper in The Dawn Patrol (1928), or a hot-tempered and hot-air flying cadet, like Spencer Tracy in Winged Victory (1942)? Or perhaps something more like Charles Lindbergh, an uneducated, inexperienced and intuitive yet fearless amateur pilot who took the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean, or the guy who played him in the movie The Spirit of St. Louis (1957)? There are all kinds of different approaches to the subject, and they all have their charms.\n",

      "When it comes to aviation, you have to admit there’s a lot of testosterone in the air. It has to be like that, since so many of the best pilots were men. It’s probably why, in a perfect world, I would have liked to have been a Navy pilot in World War II, rather than a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs). I like movies about men in planes, but I also have to admit I like movies about women in planes, too. There are plenty of good ones out there, like The Wings of Eagles (1976) and The Women\n"
