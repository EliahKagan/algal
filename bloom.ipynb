We were very intentional about making sure that we were giving accurate depictions of the aeroplanes, because we know that the general public and our fans love to research the history of aviation and understand where the planes came from. So the planes that you see are the planes that you would have seen at the time. And for the planes that are not real, we spent time talking to historians and looking at period documents to make sure that we have the right look and feel for those planes.\n",
