      "To write a compelling hero in a period video game about the history of aviation, it helps to study the original sources. In the case of the Wright Brothers, those sources provided a strong foundation for designers at Avalanche Studios. The brothers, Wilbur and Orville, were born in 1867 and 1871 respectively, and grew up on a farm near Dayton, Ohio. In their youth, the boys were interested in many subjects, but as they got older, their interests converged in a single area: flying. It was an easy subject to study, since Dayton was a center for early 20th-century aircraft production. The brothers, who had been educated in the public school system, were familiar with the scientific theories of propulsion and flight. Through their work at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field (now Huffman Prairie Airfield), they proved that their theories could be put into practice. In fact, the brothers’ first flight was achieved in a small airplane they built from a kit they purchased from the Frenchman Octave Chanute.\n",
