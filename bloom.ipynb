Although Orville is also a fascinating character, we felt it was important to highlight the Wrights as a couple, so we could explore the idea of a female pioneer in a man’s world. Lola’s story has been largely forgotten, but she was a person of great courage and fortitude.\n",

      "In terms of the historical record, we found many primary sources to draw upon, including the 1903 Kitty Hawk flight itself. As for the characters in the film, we were inspired by both the Wrights themselves and the biographies of them. We also drew from a lot of secondary sources, including Wright family histories and letters written by them to their wives.\n",
