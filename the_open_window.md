`the_open_window.txt` is:

```text
                          The Open Window

                               by

                              SAKI

                     (H. H. Munro, 1870-1916)
```

In contrast, `the_open_window_modified.txt` has one paragraph, near the end,
replaced with something unrelated, to assess if changes near the end of a long
text affect embeddings with the model I am using.
